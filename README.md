Hey, author of this project here. Not sure why this was posted on reddit and awarded repeatedly but I appreciate the attention I guess. The lack of information at the moment is somewhat deliberate, it's in architectural stages of development and not really ready for public contribution in a convenient fashion let alone production use. The gist of the project is a set of hardware abstraction APIs for interfacing with graphics, user input, networking, etc. in addition to a novel transparent RPC engine and a low-overhead micro-container system. The goal is to eliminate the idea of a discrete "application" in favor of a unified ecosystem of dynamically (i.e. runtime) interchangeable functional components. This is mostly a solo project at the moment and progress is dependent on how much free time I have at any given point to work on it. Also, for users coming from the "impact client" website, this project is in no way affiliated with Impact or used in the development of that project. Apologies for the confusion, I'm not sure why the Impact authors feel the need to mislead in this fashion. I can be contacted at @syntacticsugarglider on Telegram for further inquiries.

The most active development branches are `protocol-objects` and `containers`. Documentation is built by CI, browse artifacts for a given branch to view a rendered rustdoc page.
